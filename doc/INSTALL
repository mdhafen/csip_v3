First a few requirements.

Module Dependancies (with Debian package name in parenthesis)

mysql (php5-mysql)
ldap (php5-ldap) (Optional)
PEAR (php-pear)
Mail/RFC822 (php-mail)
MCrypt (php5-mcrypt)
Auth/OpenID (php-openid) {used by the PS auth/user external module}

Module Dependancies that are probably included with PHP
PDO
Hash


Next some configuration.

In the lib/config_sample.phpm file there are a few configuration
settings that need to be set before anything else.  Copy that file to
lib/config.phpm and set the appropriate settings as outlined below.

secure_phrase =>  This is basically a short random character string used in the
security module to make the stored passwords harder to un-encrypt.

database => Fill in at least the database connection information for the 'core'
'write' database identifier.  This will be the default database connection.
It is possible to have a 'read' identifier here as well, in order to balance
read and write database access across different servers.

authen_modules => external =>  Enter the database connection identifier (i.e. 'core') here
if you will use one of the provided modules for getting user information from
an external source.  One module has been provided for connecting to the
PowerSchool student information system.

user_external_module =>  This is the identifier for the module to be used for
getting user information from an external source.  This will use the same
Authen_External class as the authen external module for fetching user,
location, and course information from an external source.  This information
will be added to the database.

trusted_proxies => This is a list of load balancers in order for the application
url to be guessed.  The load balancer is expected to set the
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SERVER and HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO http headers, along with the
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SSL and HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PORT http headers as applicable.

Third, you will need to configure the web server.  In the apache web server it
should be as easy as creating the virtual host entry with the document root
set to the webroot folder of the application.

Fourth, point a web browser at /install.php to begin creating users.
This will also create the database tables.  If that page isn't able to create
the database tables then the files doc/DCSIP_v5_create.sql and
doc/DCSIP_v5_install.sql, in that order, can be used to create the tables by
hand.  This page will also allow you to match existing information in the
database on users, locations, and courses to information from the external
source if user_external_module is set.

Finally, if necessary, install any plugins in the external information source.
A PowerSchool plugin XML file is included in the /doc folder as an example.
The openid host attribute and link path attribute will need to be adjusted to
match your environment.
